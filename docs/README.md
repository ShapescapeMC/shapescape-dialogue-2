# About the documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Shapescape Dialogue Filter! This guide is designed to help you use the filter effectively and efficiently.

## How to use the documentation
If you're new to the filter, we recommend starting with the [Installation](/docs/installation.md) section to learn how to get set up. Once you've installed the filter, you can read the [Usage](/docs/usage.md) section to learn how to use it.

If you're looking for the documentation for an older version of the filter, you can find it on GitHub using the appropriate version tag. The links in the documentation are set up in such a way that you can use them without being redirected to the current state of the repository. For example, here is a link to the documentation for version 3.2.0:
